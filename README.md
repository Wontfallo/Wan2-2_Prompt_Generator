# Wan2-2 Prompt Generator

A small prompt generator for Wan2-2.

## Preview

## What's new

- Added an HTML version: a standalone `.html` build is now available for quick testing and distribution.
  - What it is: a single-file, static HTML version of the prompt generator that runs in the browser without any build steps or server.
  - Where to find it: `dist/index.html` (or `build/index.html` depending on your packaging). If you'd like a different path, tell me and I will adjust.
  - How to use it: open the `.html` file in any modern browser. No install required.

## Usage

- For development, run your usual build or start commands (see project scripts).
- To use the HTML version, open the file in your browser or host it via GitHub Pages.

## Notes

- Image used above is located at `images/preview.png`. If the screenshot file has a different name/path, update the image path here accordingly.
- If you'd like the README to include a link or a live demo (GitHub Pages), I can add the deployment and link it.
